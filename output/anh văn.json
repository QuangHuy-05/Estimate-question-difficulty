If parents bring up a child with the sole aim of turning the child into a genius, they will cause a disaster.

Unrealistic parental expectations can cause great damage to children. However, if parents are not too unrealistic about what they expect their children to do, but are ambitious in a sensible way, the child may succeed in doing very well - especially if the parents are very supportive of their child. Michael is very lucky. He is crazy about music, and his parents help him a lot by taking him to concerts and arranging private piano and violin lessons for him. They even drive him 50 kilometers twice a week for violin lessons. Michael's mother knows very little about music, but his father plays the trumpet in a large orchestra. However, he never makes Michael enter music competitions if he is unwilling. Winston, Michael's friend, however, is not so lucky. Both his parents are successful musicians, and they set too high a standard for Winston. They want their son to be as successful as they are and so they enter him for every piano competition held. They are very unhappy when he does not win. Winston is always afraid that he will disappoint his parents and now he always seems quiet and unhappy.

    "question": "Read the text and choose the answer A, B, C or D according to the text. Over the past 600 years, English has grown from a language of few speakers to become the dominant language of international communication. English as we know it today emerged around 1350, after having incorporated many elements of French that were introduced following the Norman invasion of 1030. Until the 1600s, English was, for the most part, spoken only in England and had not attended even as far as Wales, Scotland, or Ireland. However, during the course of the next two centuries, English began to spread around the globe as a result of exploration, trade (including slave trade), colonization, and missionary work. Thus, small enclaves of English speakers became established and grew in various parts of the world. As these communities proliferated, English gradually became the primary language of international business, banking, and diplomacy. Currently, about 80 percent of the information stored on computer systems Worldwide is in English. Two-thirds of the world’s science writing is in English, and English is the main language of technology, advertising, media, international airports, and air traffic controllers. Today there are more than 700 million English Users in the world, and over half of these are non-native speakers, constituting the largest number of non-native users than any other language in the world.

    "question": "Read the text and choose the answer A, B, C or D according to the text. Over the past 600 years, English has grown from a language of few speakers to become the dominant language of international communication. English as we know it today emerged around 1350, after having incorporated many elements of French that were introduced following the Norman invasion of 1030. Until the 1600s, English was, for the most part, spoken only in England and had not attended even as far as Wales, Scotland, or Ireland. However, during the course of the next two centuries, English began to spread around the globe as a result of exploration, trade (including slave trade), colonization, and missionary work. Thus, small enclaves of English speakers became established and grew in various parts of the world. As these communities proliferated, English gradually became the primary language of international business, banking, and diplomacy. Currently, about 80 percent of the information stored on computer systems Worldwide is in English. Two-thirds of the world’s science writing is in English, and English is the main language of technology, advertising, media, international airports, and air traffic controllers. Today there are more than 700 million English Users in the world, and over half of these are non-native speakers, constituting the largest number of non-native users than any other language in the world. What is the main topic of this passage?",

    "question": "Read the text and choose the answer A, B, C or D according to the text. Over the past 600 years, English has grown from a language of few speakers to become the dominant language of international communication. English as we know it today emerged around 1350, after having incorporated many elements of French that were introduced following the Norman invasion of 1030. Until the 1600s, English was, for the most part, spoken only in England and had not attended even as far as Wales, Scotland, or Ireland. However, during the course of the next two centuries, English began to spread around the globe as a result of exploration, trade (including slave trade), colonization, and missionary work. Thus, small enclaves of English speakers became established and grew in various parts of the world. As these communities proliferated, English gradually became the primary language of international business, banking, and diplomacy. Currently, about 80 percent of the information stored on computer systems Worldwide is in English. Two-thirds of the world’s science writing is in English, and English is the main language of technology, advertising, media, international airports, and air traffic controllers. Today there are more than 700 million English Users in the world, and over half of these are non-native speakers, constituting the largest number of non-native users than any other language in the world. Approximately when did English begin to be used beyond England?",

We enjoyed making castles and channels in the sand. People said we ought to spend at least a few weeks at the seaside. If we could stay longer, so much the better. When did they reach the seaside?",

He went to a small school in a village, and when he left school he didn’t go to university. He worked for five years in an office. But his brother, Tom, was a doctor and helped Fleming to go to university and study medicine. So he went to London University and in 1906 he became a doctor. In 1915, Fleming married Sarah McElroy, an Irish woman. They had one son. During the First World War, many soldiers died in hospital because they didn’t have the right medicines. So after the war, Fleming tried to find a drug that could help them. He worked for many years and in 1928 he discovered a new drug and he called it “penicillin”. He later worked with an Australian and a German scientist to develop a drug that doctors could use. In 1945, they won the Nobel Prize in medicine for their work on penicillin.

    "question": "Read the passage, and then decide whether the statements are true or false. The concept of parental authority has changed. Today, no parent can take their children’s respect for granted: authority has to be earned. Several studies have shown the following problems. Trust: A lot of young people say their parents don’t trust them. Some of them have no privacy: their parents read all their emails, and enter their rooms without knocking. All of these actions demonstrate lack of respect. Consequently, these teenagers have little respect for their parents. Communication: Hardly any teens discuss their problems with their parents. That’s because very few teens feel their parents really listen to them. Instead, most parents tend to fire off an immediate response to their kids’ first sentence. Freedom: Interestingly, most rebels come from very authoritarian homes where kids have very little freedom. Teens need fewer rules but they have to be clear and unchangeable. Also, if the mother and father don’t agree about discipline, teens have less respect for both parents. They also need a lot of support and a little freedom to take their own decisions. None of them enjoy just listening to adults. Role models: Teens don’t have much respect for their parents if neither of them actually does things that they expect their children to do.

    "question": "Read the passage, and choose the correct answer A, B, C or D for each question. Men have played a significant role in American society as the main breadwinner, and protector of the family. But the traditional role of men has slowly been transferred to women. Society is changing with women going to college, and gaining jobs. It may even happen in several years’ time when women are given sole earning responsibility in American society as the main breadwinner of the family. That is due in part to women gained working privileges equal to men in the 1970’s. Up until the 1970’s, men were the traditional family breadwinners, while women stayed at home, raised the kids, made dinner every night, cleaned the house, and ran all of the errands. Men went to work every day, making enough money to buy a nice home, buy a new car every so often. Once women were afforded the opportunity to work in the same jobs men once held, men’s more traditional foothold in the workplace was loosened. Women were given bigger jobs with more responsibility, but women take jobs with major responsibly with less pay than men. The role of men in American society is changing with more women going to college, and obtaining careers; men are playing more untraditional roles at home. Women are still giving birth to the kids, but are going to work to earn money to pay the bills, while men are staying home raising the kids, running errands, cleaning, making dinner. Young children, boys as well as girls, are being raised with dad at home taking care of the kids.

    "question": "Read the passage, and choose the correct answer A, B, C or D for each question. The Shuttle Era Comes to an End The set of Space Shuttle missions run by NASA captivated the world and proved that reusable spacecraft could be used to bring astronauts and cargo into space. The Space Shuttle programme had a total of six separate orbiters, five of which actually went into space. The first-made orbiter was only used to gather data about how the shuttles would glide back to the earth. This shuttle would be brought up into the air by a specially modified Boeing 747 and released to glide down without any power of its own. The Space Shuttle Era ran from the first launch on April 12, 1981, and ended when the final shuttle landed on July 21, 2011. During this time, there were 135 missions flown. Of the five shuttles that did go into space, two met with disasters that killed all the crew members aboard.The first disaster happened on January 28, 1986 when Space Shuttle Challenger ran into severe problems and exploded less than two minutes after take-off. It was a major blow to NASA as a school teacher was on board the orbiter, and the launch was being watched by children from schools across the United States. The second disaster came on February 1, 2003. After having completed its mission, Space Shuttle Columbia was returning to the earth from space. During damage done to a wing during its launch, the orbiter disintegrated as it hit the earth’s atmosphere during re-entry. Because the Space Shuttle programme was running, it largely made possible the construction of the International Space Station (ISS). The shuttles brought astronauts to the station, replenished supplies, and carried actual pieces to the Space Station up from the earth.As the Space Shuttle Era came to an end, many space lovers have been left wondering, “What’s next?” There is still plenty to explore, so we will all just have to wait and see.

    "question": "Read the passage, and choose the correct answer A, B, C or D for each question. Insects on the Menu Humans have a long history of eating insects, and it turns out that they can be a very nutritious part of a person’s regular diet. Insects have a lot of protein, and they are often easier to catch than prey animals. Therefore, it is no wonder that when our ancient ancestors saw some tasty worms or grubs wiggling on the ground, they made a quick snack of them. In Thailand, insects are a regular part of the street food that can be found. The different insects that people snack on are crickets, grasshoppers, giant water bugs, and assorted worms. They are often deep-fried and salted, so they have a crunchy texture that makes them a perfect snack food. If you can get past the fact that you are eating a cricket, it will crunch in your mouth just like a corn chip! For a lot of people, however, it is difficult to get over the fear of eating insects. People tend to see insects as invaders, especially when they are crawling on the food that we are about to eat. Therefore, being able to eat insects without feeling disgusted is cultural. Some people cannot eat French cheese or stinky tofu because they weren’t brought up doing so. To many of us, insects fall right into that category, making it difficult to even try them. If given the chance, though, be courageous. Insects can be nutritious and tasty, so long as you can get over the “yuck” factor. Which is the reason given for gathering and eating insects?",

The loads include baskets of fruits, tree trunks, live pigs, flocks of live ducks and stacked crates of raw eggs.

UNESCO World Heritage Site in Hue The Complex of Hue Monuments is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is located in the city of Hue in central Vietnam. Hue was founded as the Viet Nam capital city by Gia Long, the first king of the Nguyen Dynasty in 1802. It held this position for thirteen Nguyen kings until 1945. The massive complex features hundreds of monuments and ruins, such as the Forbidden Purple City, once the residence of the royal family and badly damaged during the Vietnam War, the Imperial City, royal tombs, the flag tower, pagodas, temples, a library and museum. Hue, located on the banks of the Huong River, (also known as the Perfume River) is about a hundred kilometres north of Da Nang. Among the most impressive monuments in this former grand imperial capital are the Ngo Mon Gate of the Imperial City which once was exclusively used by the royal family and their servants and soldiers, the tomb of Emperor Minh Mang as well as the tomb of Emperor Tu Duc. In fact, many of the monuments surrounding the royal buildings were constructed in the early 19th century and were modeled after Beijing's Forbidden City. The wall that surrounds the citadel is six metres high and two and a half kilometres long. The historical complex is known not only for its rich architecture but also for its beautiful landscape setting. Overall, the site is quite spectacular.

Son Doong Cave was formed from 2 to 5 million years ago, when the river flowed through the limestone mountain area and was buried. The water eroded limestone and created an underground tunnel.

Especially, Son Doong consists of two entrances, which is unique among explored caves in Phong Nha - Ke Bang National Park. Exploring the cave, visitors were surprised with spectacular scenery of numerous stalactites of which some giant stalagmites are more than 70 metres high. Deep inside the cave exists a grandiose tropical jungle called “Garden of Eden\" by the explorers. The jungle is home to a diversifiedsystem of fauna and flora. Besides, the cave possesses a 2.5-kilometre underground river.

Recently, we made a trip to visit Dong Ho village with a desire to meet the old artisan – Nguyen Huu Sam. Just when we arrived villagers at the dyke in the village and talked with the villagers about the artisan, they immediately told us about him. The old house owned by the artisan is situated in a long alley of the village. On the walls of the house there are many folk paintings in different genres, from daily life paintings to landscape paintings shown in a set of “four seasons”. Mr. Sam told us about his past. When he was three years old, he was instructed in the craft of making Dong Ho paintings by his father. At five, he could help his father apply the Dong Ho paintings, and learn how to print the paper with proper colours. At seven, he was able to draw with a pen and make the most difficult samples. Years went by and the soul of Dong Ho folk paintings has kept seashell powder paint to the poonah-paper. In the 1940s, this craft flourished. At that time, he was assigned by his parents to take the paintings to the market for sale. Mr. Sam said that 17 families in the village have been engaged in making Dong Ho paintings. Artisan Sam has always been devoted to the making of Dong Ho paintings and has waited for opportunities to restore this traditional craft. In 1967, when the local authorities assigned him to restore the traditional genre of Dong Ho folk paintings, he gathered 50 villagers with professional skills and collected hundreds of woodblocks to establish the Dong Ho Painting Cooperative. Thanks to his efforts, such famous painting as \"Rat's wedding\", “Rooster”, “Scene of jealousy” and “Writing verses about precious flowers\" have been revived. Dong Ho paintings have been available in many parts of the world such as Japan, France, Germany, Singapore and the United States. The themes of Dong Ho paintings are about ………..",

Khi chúng tôi đến dân làng bên đê trong làng và nói chuyện với dân làng về người nghệ nhân, họ liền kể cho chúng tôi nghe về ông.\nNgôi nhà cổ của người nghệ nhân nằm trong con hẻm dài của làng. Trên tường của ngôi nhà có rất nhiều tranh dân gian thuộc nhiều thể loại khác nhau, từ tranh đời thường đến tranh phong cảnh được thể hiện theo bộ “bốn mùa”.\nÔng Sam kể cho chúng tôi nghe về quá khứ của ông. Khi lên ba tuổi, anh đã được cha hướng dẫn nghề làm tranh Đông Hồ. Lúc 5 tuổi, cậu đã có thể giúp bố vẽ tranh Đông Hồ và học cách in giấy với màu sắc phù hợp. Lúc 7 tuổi, cậu đã có thể vẽ bằng bút và tạo ra những mẫu khó nhất. Năm tháng trôi qua, linh hồn của tranh dân gian Đông Hồ vẫn lưu giữ màu sơn bột vỏ sò trên giấy dó.\nVào những năm 1940, nghề này phát triển mạnh mẽ.

Bat Trang Pottery Village Bat Trang, a traditional porcelain and pottery village with history of seven centuries, is an interesting attraction in Ha Noi that tourists should not ignore. Located in an area rich in clay, the village has advantage of ingredients to create fine ceramics. Moreover, lying beside the Red River, between Thang Long and Pho Hien, two ancient trade centers in the north of Viet Nam during the 15th -17th centuries. Bat Trang's ceramics were favourite products not only in the domesticmarket, but also foreign ones thanks to Japanese, Chinese and Western trading boats that passed by. In the 18th and 19th centuries, due to restricting foreign trade policy of Trinh, Nguyen dynasties, it was difficult for pottery products in Viet Nam to be exported to foreign countries, and some famous pottery-making villages like Bat Trang, or Chu Dau (Hai Duong province) went through a hard time. Since 1986, thanks to economic reforms and development, more attention has been paid to the village and the world gets a chance to know more about Vietnamese porcelain through many high quality exported Bat Trang's ceramic products. Bat Trang ceramics are produced for daily household use (bows,cups, plates, pots, bottles…), worshipping, or decoration purposes.

    "question": "Read the text and do the task below. Last year I visited the Somerset Levels, a coastal plain and wetland area in Somerset, South West England. This area is home to one of Somerset’s oldest traditional crafts - willow basket making. Basket making began in the area a long time ago.

I’d seen willow baskets before I visited the Levels, but I was still amazed at the numerous products created by the basket makers there. They make lobster pots, bread trays, and even passenger baskets for hot air balloons. Although the arrival of plastics in the 1950s caused the basket making industry to decline, willow growing and basket making have continued to play a significant role in Somerset’s rural economy. Willow growers and basket makers have dealt with this challenge by finding new markets and innovative ways of using willow. They make willow charcoal for artists and bower seats for gardens.

    "question": "Read the text and do the task below. Last year I visited the Somerset Levels, a coastal plain and wetland area in Somerset, South West England. This area is home to one of Somerset’s oldest traditional crafts - willow basket making. Basket making began in the area a long time ago. At the beginning of the 19th century, more than three thousand acres of willow trees were planted commercially there because the area provided an excellent natural habitat for their cultivation. I’d seen willow baskets before I visited the Levels, but I was still amazed at the numerous products created by the basket makers there. They make lobster pots, bread trays, and even passenger baskets for hot air balloons. Although the arrival of plastics in the 1950s caused the basket making industry to decline, willow growing and basket making have continued to play a significant role in Somerset’s rural economy. Willow growers and basket makers have dealt with this challenge by finding new markets and innovative ways of using willow. They make willow charcoal for artists and bower seats for gardens. Some even weave willow coffins. Therefore, people here can still live on the craft that their great-grandparents passed down to them. Decide T (true)/ F (false) for each statement. Willow growers and basket makers have found new ways to promote their industry.",
